This is an noarch RPM build for any RPM based system. The idea was to take all of my favorite zsh plugins from github and build a manageable way to deploy these plugins on my servers.

To enable the zsh configuration for a single user:
 - sudo cp -vf /etc/skel/.zsh-extras /home/<user>/

To enable the zsh configuration globally: 
 - sudo mv -v /etc/zshrc /etc/zshrc.bak && sudo cp -v /etc/skel/.zsh-extras /etc/zshrc
